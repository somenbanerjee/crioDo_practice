        <h5>By James Clear</h5>
        <p>
          World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler
          system for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change comes
          from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions - doing two
          push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single
          short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.
